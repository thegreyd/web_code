        <p>But fortunately, Keepass has an excellent solution in its hands, just like this, 
          for the browser. Itâ€™s called ChromeIpass. Ya, it is a browser extension(was originally
          developed for firefox, as Passifox, by the same author). It works by allowing the
          the browser to communicate with your offline Keepass database, via a plugin called 
          Keepasshttp, and automatically filling the login credentials of the respective 
          site(which has to be mentioned correctly in the database). Great!

          keepass. It is like a gateway to my online world. I have to set it up everywhere in
